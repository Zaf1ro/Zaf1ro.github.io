## 362. Design Hit Counter
### 1. Description
Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past `5` minutes (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

Your system should accept a `timestamp` parameter (in seconds granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.

Implement the `HitCounter` class:
* `HitCounter()` Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
* `void hit(int timestamp)` Records a hit that happened at `timestamp` (**in seconds**). Several hits may happen at the same timestamp.
* `int getHits(int timestamp)` Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from `timestamp` (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

Example:
```
Input
["HitCounter", "hit", "hit", "hit", "getHits", "hit", "getHits", "getHits"]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 3]

Explanation
HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.
hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.
hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.
hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.
hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.
hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.
hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.
```

### 2. Solution
由于timestamp是单调递增的, 因此每次`hit`或`getHits`都等于或大于前一个timestamp. 因此`getHits`分为两种情况:
* $\text{timestamp} \leq 300$: 之前所有hit都在范围内
* $\text{imestamp} > 300$: 需找到`timestamp-300`的边界, 排除该边界之前的hit

由于hit也是单调递增, 因此

```java
/**
 * Your HitCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * HitCounter obj = new HitCounter();
 * obj.hit(timestamp);
 * int param_2 = obj.getHits(timestamp);
 */
class HitCounter {
    private int[] arr = new int[300];
    private int count = 0;

    public HitCounter() {}
    
    public void hit(int timestamp) {
        arr[count++] = timestamp;
    }
    
    public int getHits(int timestamp) {
        if (timestamp <= 300) return count;
        int l = 0, r = count, t = timestamp-300;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
            if (arr[m] <= t) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else {
                r = m;
            }
        }
        return count - l;
    }
}
```
