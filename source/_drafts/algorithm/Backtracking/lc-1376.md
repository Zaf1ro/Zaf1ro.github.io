A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company is the one with `headID`.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After `informTime[i]` minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.

Example:
```
        2
    / / | \ \
   0 1  3  4 5

Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.
The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown.
```

### 2. Solution
由于员工结构是树形的, 可从`headID`出发, 找到其下属, 并递归直到叶子节点. 需要注意几点:
* 由于是树形, 不存在circle, 因此无需记录访问过的节点
* 从根节点`headID`到叶子节点上路径的informTime相加, 取路径上informTime的最大值

```java
class Solution {
    private List<Integer>[] map;
    private int res = 0;

    public int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
        map = new List[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) map[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (manager[i] != -1) map[manager[i]].add(i);
        }
        dfs(headID, 0, informTime);
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(int i, int time, int[] informTime) {
        List<Integer> subs = map[i];
        if (subs.isEmpty()) {
            res = Math.max(res, time);
            return;
        }
        for (int j: subs) dfs(j, time+informTime[i], informTime);
    }
}
```

上述算法存在两个问题: 
* 树的中间节点可能被访问很多次: 记录每个节点所在子树的最大informTime
* 由于只需要找到最大informTime的路径, 因此不必从根节点出发, 也可通过`managers`从叶子节点向上遍历

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, backtracking(i, manager, informTime));
        }
        return res;
    }

    private int backtracking(int id, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
        if (manager[id] != -1) {
            informTime[id] += backtracking(manager[id], manager, informTime);
            manager[id] = -1;
        }
        return informTime[id];
    }
}
```
