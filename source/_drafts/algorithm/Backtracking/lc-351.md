## 351 Android Unlock Patterns
### 1. Description
Android devices have a special lock screen with a `3 x 3` grid of dots. Users can set an "unlock pattern" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of `k` dots is a **valid** unlock pattern if both of the following are true:
* All the dots in the sequence are distinct.
* If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through the center of any other dot, the other dot must have previously appeared in the sequence. No jumps through the center non-selected dots are allowed.
    * For example, connecting dots `2` and `9` without dots `5` or `6` appearing beforehand is valid because the line from dot `2` to dot `9` does not pass through the center of either dot `5` or `6`.
    * However, connecting dots `1` and `3` without dot `2` appearing beforehand is invalid because the line from dot `1` to dot `3` passes through the center of dot `2`.

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 1, n = 1
Output: 9
```
Example 2:
```
Input: m = 1, n = 2
Output: 65
```

### 2. Solution
该题需要注意一下几点:
* 1到9, 1到3, 1到7, 2到8, 3到9, 4到6, 7到9(反之亦然): 这些滑动会经过中间节点, 需要确保中间节点之前被访问过
* 同一个节点不能访问两次
* 从1出发, 和从3,7,9出发并没有区别, (2,4,6,8)同理, 5则是一个孤例

```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] cross = new int[10][10];

    public int numberOfPatterns(int m, int n) {
        cross[1][3] = cross[3][1] = 2;
        cross[3][9] = cross[9][3] = 6;
        cross[1][7] = cross[7][1] = 4;
        cross[7][9] = cross[9][7] = 8;
        cross[1][9] = cross[9][1] = cross[3][7] = cross[7][3] = 5;
        cross[2][8] = cross[8][2] = cross[4][6] = cross[6][4] = 5;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = m; i <= n; i++) {
            res += 4 * helper(1, i, new boolean[10]);
            res += 4 * helper(2, i, new boolean[10]);
            res += helper(5, i, new boolean[10]);
        }
        return res;
    }

    private int helper(int m, int n, boolean[] visited) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        int res = 0;
        visited[m] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            int x = cross[m][i];
            if (visited[i] || (x != 0 && !visited[x])) continue;
            res += helper(i, n-1, visited);
        }
        visited[m] = false;
        return res;
    }
}
```
