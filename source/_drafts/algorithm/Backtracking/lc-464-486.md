## 464. Can I Win
### 1. Description
In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.

Example:
```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    Boolean[] dp = new Boolean[1 << 21];

    public boolean canIWin(int max, int desired) {
        if (max * (max+1) / 2 < desired) return false;
        if (max >= desired) return true;
        return helper(max, desired, 0);
    }

    private boolean helper(int max, int total, int mask) {
        if (dp[mask] != null) return dp[mask];
        for (int i = max; i >= 1; i--) {
            if (((1 << i) & mask) != 0) continue;
            if (total <= i || !helper(max, total-i, mask|(1<<i))) {
                dp[mask] = true;
                return true;
            }
        }
        dp[mask] = false;
        return false;
    }
}
```


## 486 Predict the Winner
### 1. Description
You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

### 2. Solution
假设数组的当前左边界为`l`, 右边界为`r`, player 1有四种情况:
* player 1选择`nums[l]`:
    * player 2选择`nums[l+1]`
    * player 2选择`nums[r]`
* player 1选择`nums[r]`:
    * player 2选择`nums[l]`
    * player 2选择`nums[r-1]`

对player 2的选择取最小值, 换句话说, 让player 2选择最大值; 对player 1的选择取最大值.

```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] dp;

    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length, sum = 0;
        for (int num: nums) sum += num;
        this.dp = new int[n][n];
        return backtracking(nums, 0, n-1) * 2 >= sum;
    }

    private int backtracking(int[] nums, int l, int r) {
        if (l > r) return 0;
        if (l == r) return nums[l];
        if (dp[l][r] > 0) return dp[l][r];
        int lmax = nums[l] + Math.min(backtracking(nums, l+2, r), backtracking(nums, l+1, r-1));
        int rmax = nums[r] + Math.min(backtracking(nums, l, r-2), backtracking(nums, l+1, r-1));
        dp[l][r] = Math.max(lmax, rmax);
        return dp[l][r];
    }
}
```


## 294. Flip Game II
### 1. Description
You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return `true` if the starting player can **guarantee a win**, and `false` otherwise.

Example:
```
Input: currentState = "++++"
Output: true
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    private Map<String, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();

    public boolean canWin(String currentState) {
        return helper(currentState.toCharArray());
    }

    private boolean helper(char[] arr) {
        String s = new String(arr);
        if (map.containsKey(s)) return map.get(s);
        boolean flag = false;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length && !flag; i++) {
            if (arr[i-1] == '-' || arr[i] == '-') continue;
            arr[i-1] = arr[i] = '-';
            if (!helper(arr)) {
                flag = true;
            }
            arr[i-1] = arr[i] = '+';
        }
        map.put(s, flag);
        return flag;
    }
}
```
