## 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
### 1. Description
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.

The `$i^{th}$` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.


### 2. Solution
使用二分法, 先选择一个容量, 存在两种可能:
* 该容量无法在指定天数内运完货物: `left = mid + 1`
* 该容量可准时或提前运完货物: `right = mid`

```java
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int l = 1, r = 0;
        for (int w: weights) r += w;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + ((r - l) >> 1), d = helper(weights, m);
            if (d > days) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else {
                r = m;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }

    private int helper(int[] weights, int capacity) {
        int res = 1, c = capacity;
        for (int w: weights) {
            if (capacity < w) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            if (c < w) {
                c = capacity;
                res++;
            }
            c -= w;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
