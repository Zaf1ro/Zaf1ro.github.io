## 722. Remove Comments
### 1. Description
Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings `source` where `source[i]` is the `$i^{th}$` line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `'\n'`.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
* The string `"//"` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
* The string `"/*"` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `"*/"` should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string `"/*/"` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.
* For example, if the string `"//"` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
* Similarly, if the string `"/*"` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
* For example, `source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";"` will not be a test case.

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `"/*"` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.


### 2. Solution
假设当前字符串为`s`, 索引为`i`, 会遇到三种可能性:
* `s[i] == '/'`且`s[i+1] == '*'`: 开始注释
* `s[i] == '*'`且`s[i+1] == '/'`: 结束注释
* `s[i] == '/'`且`s[i+1] == '/'`: 跳过本行

注意, 第二种情况必须基于第一种情况, 因此需要一个`boolean`变量标记注释是否结束

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> removeComments(String[] source) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        boolean flag = false;
        for (String s: source) {
            int n = s.length();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (flag) {
                    if (i+1 < n && s.charAt(i) == '*' && s.charAt(i+1) == '/') {
                        flag = false;
                        i++;
                    }
                } else if (!flag && i+1 < n && s.charAt(i) == '/' && s.charAt(i+1) == '/') {
                    break;
                } else if (i+1 < n && s.charAt(i) == '/' && s.charAt(i+1) == '*') {
                    flag = true;
                    i++;
                } else {
                    sb.append(s.charAt(i));
                }
            }
            if (!flag && sb.length() > 0) {
                res.add(sb.toString());
                sb.setLength(0);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
