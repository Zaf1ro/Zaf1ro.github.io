## 1135 Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost
### 1. Description
There are `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer n and an array `connections` where `$connections[i] = [x_i, y_i, cost_i]$` indicates that the cost of connecting city `$x_i$` and city `$y_i$` (bidirectional connection) is `$cost_i$`.
Return the minimum cost to connect all the `n` cities such that there is at least one path between each pair of cities. If it is impossible to connect all the `n` cities, return `-1`,
The **cost** is the sum of the connections' costs used.

Example:
```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
```

### 2. Solution
将cost按从低到高排序, 依次连接各个城市, 如果两个城市已经连通, 则无需使用该次cost, 因为之前已经以更低cost连接.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCost(int n, int[][] connections) {
        Arrays.sort(connections, (a,b)->a[2]-b[2]);
        int[] parents = new int[n+1], ranks = new int[n+1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) parents[i] = i;
        int res = 0, cnt = n;
        for (int[] conn: connections) {
            int p1 = find(parents, conn[0]), p2 = find(parents, conn[1]);
            if (p1 == p2) continue;
            union(parents, ranks, p1, p2);
            res += conn[2];
            cnt--;
        }
        return cnt == 1 ? res : -1;
    }

    private int find(int[] parents, int i) {
        while (parents[i] != i) i = parents[i];
        return i;
    }

    private void union(int[] parents, int[] ranks, int i, int j) {
        if (ranks[i] <= ranks[j]) {
            parents[i] = j;
            if (ranks[i] == ranks[j]) ranks[j]++;
        } else {
            parents[j] = i;
        }
    }
}
```
