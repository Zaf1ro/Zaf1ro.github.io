## 474. Ones and Zeroes
### 1. Description
You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.
Return the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most** `m` `0`'s and `n` `1`'s in the subset.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

Example:
```
Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
```

### 2. Solution
对于一个二维数组`dp`, `dp[i][j]`表示`i`个`0`, `j`个`1`的情况下拥有的字符串最多个数. 假设某个字符串`s`拥有`a`个`0`, `b`个`1`, 则`dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i-a][j-b])`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m+1][n+1];
        for (String s: strs) {
            int zeros = 0, ones = 0;
            for (char c: s.toCharArray()) {
                if (c == '0') zeros++;
                else ones++;
            }
            for (int i = m; i >= zeros; i--) {
                for (int j = n; j >= ones; j--) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-zeros][j-ones]+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
