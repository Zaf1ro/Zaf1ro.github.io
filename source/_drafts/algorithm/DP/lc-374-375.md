### 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
### 1. Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:
* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return the number that I picked.

### 2. Solution
```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * int guess(int num);
 */
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int l = 1, r = n;
        while (true) {
            int m = l + ((r - l) >> 1), res = guess(m);
            if (res == 0) return m;
            else if (res == -1) r = m-1;
            else l = m+1;
        }
    }
}
```


## 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
### 1. Description
We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:
1. I pick a number between 1 and n.
2. You guess a number.
3. If you guess the right number, **you win the game**.
4. If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is **higher or lower**, and you will continue guessing.
5. Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, **you lose the game**.

Given a particular `n`, return the minimum amount of money you need to **guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick**.

Example:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay \$7.
    - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
        - If this is my number, your total is \$7. Otherwise, you pay \$9.
        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is \$7 + \$9 = \$16.
        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is \$7 + \$9 = \$16.
    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
        - If this is my number, your total is \$7. Otherwise, you pay \$3.
        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
            - If this is my number, your total is \$7 + \$3 = \$10. Otherwise, you pay \$5.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is \$7 + \$3 + \$5 = \$15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is \$7 + \$3 + \$5 = \$15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is \$7 + \$3 = \$10. Otherwise, you pay \$1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is \$7 + \$3 + \$1 = \$11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay \$16. Hence, you only need \$16 to guarantee a win.
```

### 2. Solution
假设$f(i,j)$表示猜测[i,j]范围内数字所需的最小金额, 且已知$f(i,m-1)$和$f(m+1,j)$的结果, 则: $f(i,j) = m + max(f(i,m-1), f(m+1,j))$. 对于$f(1,n)$, 可选择$[1,n]$之间任意数作为分隔点, 并不断二分.

```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] dp;

    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        dp = new int[n+1][n+1];
        return helper(1, n);
    }

    private int helper(int l, int r) {
        if (l >= r) return 0; 
        if (l + 1 == r) return l;
        if (dp[l][r] > 0) return dp[l][r];
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            res = Math.min(res, i+Math.max(helper(l, i-1), helper(i+1, r)));
        }
        dp[l][r] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
```
