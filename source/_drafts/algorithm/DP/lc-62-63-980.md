## 62. Unique Paths
### 1. Description
There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m-1][n-1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `$2 * 10^9$`.

Example:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

### 2. Solution
由于机器人只能向下或向右移动, 因此左下角或右上角都只有一种走法. 除上述两种情况外, 假设机器人想要移动到$(x, y)$, 则必须先移动到$(x-1, y)$或$(x, y-1)$, 可得:
$$dp[x][y] = dp[x-1][y] + dp[x][y-1]$$

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) dp[0][j] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) dp[i][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```


## 63. Unique Paths II
### 1. Description
You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m-1][n-1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `$2 * 10^9$`.

Example:
```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m && obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0; i++) dp[i][0] = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n && obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0; j++) dp[0][j] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) continue;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```


## 980. Unique Paths III
### 1. Description
You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid` where `grid[i][j]` could be:
* `1` representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
* `2` representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
* `0` representing empty squares we can walk over.
* `-1` representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

Example:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    private int res = 0, block = 0;
    
    public int uniquePathsIII(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length, x = 0, y = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    x = i;
                    y = j;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == -1) {
                    block++;
                }
            }
        }
        backtracking(grid, x, y, m, n, 1);
        return res;
    }

    private void backtracking(int[][] grid, int i, int j, int m, int n, int cnt) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || grid[i][j] == -1) return;
        if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
            if (cnt + block == m * n) res++;
            return;
        }
        grid[i][j] = -1;
        backtracking(grid, i+1, j, m, n, cnt+1);
        backtracking(grid, i-1, j, m, n, cnt+1);
        backtracking(grid, i, j+1, m, n, cnt+1);
        backtracking(grid, i, j-1, m, n, cnt+1);
        grid[i][j] = 0;
    }
}
```
