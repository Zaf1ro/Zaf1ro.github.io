## 322. Coin Change
### 1. Description
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.
Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example:
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

### 2. Solution
思路: 代码思路与上一题相同, 但通过数组来记忆上一次减少amount时的coin数量
Time Complexity: $O(mn), \quad \text{m为coin数量, n为amount}$
Space Complexity: $O(n), \quad \text{n为amount}$ 
```java
class Solution {
  public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    if (amount < 0) 
      return -1;
    
    int[] res = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(res, amount + 1);
    res[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++)
      for (int coin: coins)
        if (i >= coin)
          res[i] = Math.min(res[i], res[i - coin] + 1);
    
    return res[amount] > amount ? -1 : res[amount];
  }
}
```


## 518. Coin Change 2
### 1. Description
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.
Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

Example:
```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int coin: coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] += dp[i-coin];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```
