## 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum
### 1. Description
You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

Example:
```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```

### 2. Solution
假设已知`[0,i]`区间内的最短子数组为`m`, `[i,j]`区间内的最短子数组为`n`, 则`[0,j]`区间的两个子数组最短长度为`m+n`. 使用滑动窗口寻找子数组之和为`target`的区间, 分为两种情况:
* 可以找到子数组之和为`target`的区间, 记录`[i,j]`与`[0,i-1]`的长度之和
* 无法找到子数组之和为`target`的区间: 改为上个区级长度

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {
        int sum = 0, n = arr.length, res = n+1;
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = n;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
            while (j <= i && sum > target) sum -= arr[j++];
            if (sum == target) {
                int len = i - j + 1;
                res = Math.min(res, len+dp[j]);
                dp[i+1] = Math.min(dp[i], len);
            } else {
                dp[i+1] = dp[i];
            }
        }
        return res <= n ? res : -1;
    }
}
```
