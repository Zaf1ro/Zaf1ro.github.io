## 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
### 1. Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest **non-empty** subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
```

### 2. Solution
使用滑动窗口, 以当前坐标`i`作为子数组的右边界, 移动左边界. 由于最大差值是子数组中的最大值减去最小值, 因此需要维护两个单调队列, 一个维护递增序列, 一个维护递减序列, 只需计算两个队列头部的差值, 分为两种情况:
* 差值大于`k`: 移除左边界的元素, 以减少差值
* 差值小于或等于`k`: 无需移动左边界

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        Queue<Integer> asc = new LinkedList<>(), desc = new LinkedList<>();
        int l = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (!asc.isEmpty() && asc.peek() > nums[i]) asc.poll();
            while (!desc.isEmpty() && desc.peek() < nums[i]) desc.poll();
            asc.offer(nums[i]);
            desc.offer(nums[i]);
            while (desc.peek() - asc.peek() > limit) {
                if (asc.peek() == nums[l]) asc.poll();
                if (desc.peek() == nums[l]) desc.poll();
                l++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, i-l+1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
