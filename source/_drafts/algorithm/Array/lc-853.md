## 853. Car Fleet
### 1. Description
There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `$i^{th}$` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `$i^{th}$` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination.

Example:
```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```

### 2. Solution
按照终点距离从小到大排序, 对于第一辆车, 其必定成为一个车队, 对于后面的车, 假设其坐标为`i`, 则前面车的坐标为`i-1`, 存在两种可能:
* `i`到终点的时间大于`i-1`到终点的时间: `i`无法追上`i-1`, 形成新的车队
* `i`到终点的时间小于或等于`i-1`到终点的时间: `i`可以追上`i-1`, 不形成新的车队

```java
class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        int n = position.length, res = 0;
        double time = 0;
        int[][] arr = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i][0] = position[i];
            arr[i][1] = speed[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a,b)->b[0]-a[0]);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            double t = (target - arr[i][0] + 0.0) / arr[i][1];
            if (t > time) {
                res++;
                time = t;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
