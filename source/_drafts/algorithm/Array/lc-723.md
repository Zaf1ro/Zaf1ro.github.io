## 723. Candy Crush
### 1. Description
This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.
Given an `m x n` integer array `board` representing the grid of candy where `board[i][j]` represents the type of candy. A value of `board[i][j] == 0` represents that the cell is empty.
The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:
* If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, crush them all at the same time - these positions become empty.
* After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.
* After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.
* If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (i.e., the board is stable), then return the current board.

Example:
```
Input: board = [
  [110,  5,112,113,114],
  [210,211,  5,213,214],
  [310,311,  3,313,314],
  [410,411,412,  5,414],
  [  5,  1,512,  3,  3],
  [610,  4,  1,613,614],
  [710,  1,  2,713,714],
  [810,  1,  2,  1,  1],
  [  1,  1,  2,  2,  2],
  [  4,  1,  4,  4,  101]]
Output: [
  [  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
  [  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
  [  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
  [110,  0,  0,  0,114],
  [210,  0,  0,  0,214],
  [310,  0,  0,113,314],
  [410,  0,  0,213,414],
  [610,211,112,313,614],
  [710,311,412,613,714],
  [810,411,512,713,101]
]
```

### 2. Solution
整个算法拆为两部分:
* 检查是否存在三个或三个以上相同元素
* 若存在, 则从下向上消除重复元素, 并回到第一步
* 若不存在, 返回`board`

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] candyCrush(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        boolean[][] crush = new boolean[m][n];
        boolean flag = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 0) continue;
                if (j < n-2 && board[i][j] == board[i][j+1] && board[i][j] == board[i][j+2]) {
                    crush[i][j] = crush[i][j+1] = crush[i][j+2] = flag = true;
                }
                if (i < m-2 && board[i][j] == board[i+1][j] && board[i][j] == board[i+2][j]) {
                    crush[i][j] = crush[i+1][j] = crush[i+2][j] = flag = true;
                }
            }
        }
        if (!flag) return board;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int k = m - 1;
            for (int i = m-1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (!crush[i][j]) board[k--][j] = board[i][j];
            }
            while (k >= 0) board[k--][j] = 0;
        }
        return candyCrush(board);
    }
}
```
