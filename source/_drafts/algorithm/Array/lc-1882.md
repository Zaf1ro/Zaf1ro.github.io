## 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers
### 1. Description
You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n`​​​​​​ and `m`​​​​​​ respectively. `servers[i]` is the weight of the `$i​​​​​​^{th}$`​​​​ server, and `tasks[j]` is the time needed to process the `$j^{​​​​​​th}$`​​​​ task **in seconds**.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a **task queue**. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is **empty**.

At second `j`, the `$j^{​​​​​​th}$`​​​​ task is **inserted** into the queue (starting with the `$0^{​​​​​​th}$`​​​​ task being inserted at second `0`). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the **smallest weight**, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the **smallest index**.

If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned **in order of insertion** following the weight and index priorities above.

A server that is assigned task `j` at second `t` will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.

Build an array `ans`​​​​ of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the **index** of the server the `$j^{​​​​​​th}$`​​​​ task will be assigned to.

Return the array `ans`​​​​.

Example:
```
Input: servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
Output: [2,2,0,2,1,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.
- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.
- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] assignTasks(int[] servers, int[] tasks) {
        int m = servers.length, n = tasks.length;
        int[] res = new int[n], times = new int[m];
        PriorityQueue<Integer> waiting = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->servers[a]==servers[b]?a-b:servers[a]-servers[b]), 
            processing = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->times[a]-times[b]);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) waiting.offer(i);
        int i = 0, t = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            while (!processing.isEmpty() && times[processing.peek()] <= t) {
                waiting.offer(processing.poll());
            }
            while (i < n && !waiting.isEmpty() && i <= t) {
                int s = waiting.poll();
                times[s] = t + tasks[i];
                processing.offer(s);
                res[i++] = s;
            }
            t = waiting.isEmpty() ? times[processing.peek()] : t+1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
