## 134 Gas Station
### 1. Description
There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `$i^{th}$` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `$i^{th}$` station to its next `$(i + 1)^{th}$` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be **unique**

Example:
```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

### 2. Solution
该问题可分为两个子问题:
* 1. 是否存在一个出发点能够完成整个遍历: 假设存在`n`个gas, 若$\sum_{i=0}^{n} gas[i]-cost[i] < 0$, 则任何位置出发都不能完成遍历.
* 2. 如何找到初始节点: 假设存在`n`个gas, 且一定存在某个出发点可以完成遍历($\sum_{i=0}^{n} gas[i]-cost[i] \geq 0$), 对于坐标`j`, 若$\sum_{i=0}^{j} gas[i]-cost[i] = -k < 0$, 则$\sum_{i=j+1}^{n} gas[i]-cost[i] \geq k$, 记录剩余油量的最小值, 则下一个坐标即为最佳出发点.

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int sum = 0, min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            sum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (sum < min) {
                min = sum;
                res = i + 1;
            }
        }
        return sum < 0 ? -1 : res % gas.length;
    }
}
```
