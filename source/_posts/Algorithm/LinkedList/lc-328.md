## 328. Odd Even Linked List
### 1. Description
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.
Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

Example:
```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

### 2. Solution
思路: 使用两个节点来跟踪奇数位置的节点和偶数位置的节点, 最后将两个链表连接即可得结果
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode odd = head, evenHead = head.next, even = evenHead;
        while (even != null && even.next != null) {
            odd.next = even.next;
            odd = odd.next;
            even.next = odd.next;
            even = even.next;
        }
        odd.next = evenHead;
        return head;
    }
}
```
