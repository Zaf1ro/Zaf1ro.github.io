## 310. Minimum Height Trees
### 1. Description
A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [$a_i$, $b_i$]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `$a_i$` and `$b_i$` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return a list of all **MHTs'** root labels. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

Example:
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findMinHeightTrees(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<Integer>[] map = new List[n];
        int[] degree = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) map[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] edge: edges) {
            map[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            map[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
            degree[edge[0]]++;
            degree[edge[1]]++;
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (degree[i] < 2) {
                q.offer(i);
                visited[i] = true;
            }
        }
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            res.clear();
            while (size-- > 0) {
                int i = q.poll();
                res.add(i);
                for (int j: map[i]) {
                    if (!visited[j] && --degree[j] < 2) {
                        visited[j] = true;
                        q.offer(j);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
