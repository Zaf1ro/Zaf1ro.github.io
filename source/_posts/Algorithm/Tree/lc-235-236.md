## 235 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
### 1. Description
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

### 2. Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        return root;
    }
}
```
