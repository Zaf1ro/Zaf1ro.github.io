## 222 Count Complete Tree Nodes
### 1. Description
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
Definition of a complete binary tree:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `$2^h$` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

### 2. Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *   int val;
 *   TreeNode left;
 *   TreeNode right;
 *   TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        TreeNode left = root, right = root;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (left != null) { left = left.left; l++; }
        while (right != null) { right = right.right; r++; }
        if (l == r) return (int)Math.pow(2, l) - 1;
        return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
    }
}
```
