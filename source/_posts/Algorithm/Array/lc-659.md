## 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences
### 1. Description
You are given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
Determine if it is possible to split `nums` into **one or more subsequences** such that **both** of the following conditions are true:
* Each subsequence is a **consecutive increasing sequence** (i.e. each integer is **exactly one** more than the previous integer).
* All subsequences have a length of 3 **or more**.

Return `true` if you can split `nums` according to the above conditions, or `false` otherwise.
A **subsequence** of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., `[1,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,3,2]` is not).

Constraints:
* `$1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^4$`
* `$-1000 \leq nums[i] \leq 1000$`
* `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```

### 2. Solution
若某个数未被消耗完, 不能与前面组成序列, 也不能与后面组成序列, 则无法完成分割.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int[] nums) {
        int[] count = new int[2001];
        for (int num: nums) ++count[num+1000];
        for (int num: nums) {
            int cnt = 1, len = 0, m = num+1000;
            while (count[m] >= cnt) {
                cnt = count[m++]--;
                len++;
            }
            if (len > 0 && len < 3) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
