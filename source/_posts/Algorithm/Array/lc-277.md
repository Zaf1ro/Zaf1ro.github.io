## 277. Find the Celebrity
### 1. Description
Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

### 2. Solution
随机挑选一个人, 存在两种可能:
* 该用户不认识任何人: 此人可能是celebrity, 因为可能有人不认识此人; 但其他人一定不是celebrity, 因为此人不认识其他人
* 该用户认识某个人: 此人一定不是celebrity, 但此人认识的人可能是celebrity

假设`0`为celebrity, 从左向右遍历数组, 假设当前索引为`i`, 分为两种情况:
* `knows(0, i)`为`true`:
  * `0`一定不是`celebrity`
  * `i`可能是`celebrity`
* `knows(0, i)`为`false`:
  * `0`可能是`celebrity`
  * `i`一定不是`celebrity`

无论`knows(0, i)`的结果如何, 都可以排除一个人, 因此最后剩下的人可能是celebrity, 其他人则一定不是celebrity.

```java
/* The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
   boolean knows(int a, int b); */
public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (knows(res, i)) res = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (res == i) continue;
            if (knows(res, i) || !knows(i, res)) return -1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
