## 299 Bulls and Cows
### 1. Description
You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
For example:
```text
Secret number:  "1807"
Friend's guess: "7810"
```

Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. In the above example, your function should return **1A3B**.

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits, for example:
```text
Secret number:  "1123"
Friend's guess: "0111"
```

In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, and your function should return **1A1B**.
You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

### 2. Solution
思路: bulls很容易判断, 只要数值和位置相同即可; 难点在于cows, 因为需要考虑secret和guess中该数值的数量, 分两种情况:
1. secret中x的个数 != guess中x的个数, 取secret和guess中x的个数的最小值
2. secret中x的个数 = guess中x的个数, 取secret中x的个数

```java
class Solution {
  public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
    int bull = 0, cow = 0;
    int[] nums = new int[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++) {
      int n1 = secret.charAt(i) - '0';
      int n2 = guess.charAt(i) - '0';
      if (n1 == n2) { 
        bull++;
      } else {
        if (nums[n1] < 0) cow++;
        if (nums[n2] > 0) cow++;
        nums[n1]++;
        nums[n2]--;
      }
    }
    return bull + "A" + cow + "B";
  }
}
```
