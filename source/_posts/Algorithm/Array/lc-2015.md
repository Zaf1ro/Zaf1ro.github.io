## 2015. Average Height of Buildings in Each Segment
### 1. Description
A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array `buildings`, where `buildings[i] = [$start_i, end_i, height_i$]`. This means that there is a building with `$height_i$` in the **half-closed segment** `$[start_i, end_i)$`.

You want to describe the heights of the buildings on the street with the **minimum** number of non-overlapping **segments**. The street can be represented by the 2D integer array `street` where `street[j] = [$left_j, right_j, average_j$]` describes a **half-closed segment** `[$left_j, right_j$)` of the road where the average heights of the buildings in the segment is `$average_j$`.

Given `buildings`, return the 2D integer array `street` as described above (**excluding** any areas of the street where there are no buldings). You may return the array in **any order**.

The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided (**integer division**) by `n`.

A **half-closed segment** `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points `a` and `b` **including** point `a` and **not including** point `b`.

Example:
```
Input: buildings = [[1,4,2],[3,9,4]]
Output: [[1,3,2],[3,4,3],[4,9,4]]
Explanation:
From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2.
From 3 to 4, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3.
From 4 to 9, there is only the second building with an average height of 4 / 1 = 4.
```


### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] averageHeightOfBuildings(int[][] buildings) {
        int[][] arr = new int[buildings.length*2][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < buildings.length; i++) {
            arr[i*2] = new int[]{buildings[i][0], buildings[i][2]};
            arr[i*2+1] = new int[]{buildings[i][1], -buildings[i][2]};
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a,b)->a[0]-b[0]);
        int sum = 0, cnt = 0, prev = 0;
        Deque<int[]> res = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int[] p: arr) {
            int i = p[0], h = p[1];
            if (cnt > 0 && i > prev) {
                int avg = sum / cnt;
                if (!res.isEmpty() && res.peekLast()[1] == prev && res.peekLast()[2] == avg) {
                    res.peekLast()[1] = i;
                } else {
                    res.offer(new int[]{prev, i, avg});
                } 
            }
            sum += h;
            cnt += h > 0 ? 1 : -1;
            prev = i;
        }
        return res.toArray(new int[res.size()][3]);
    }
}
```
