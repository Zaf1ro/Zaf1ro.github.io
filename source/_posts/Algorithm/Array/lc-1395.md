## 1395. Count Number of Teams
### 1. Description
There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a **unique** `rating` value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:
* Choose 3 soldiers with index `(i, j, k)` with rating (`rating[i]`, `rating[j]`, `rating[k]`).
* A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`i < j < k`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions.

Example:
```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
```

### 2. Solution
假设数组当前坐标为`i`, 遍历`[0, i-1]`之间的元素, 假设坐标为`j`, 分为两种情况:
* `rating[i] < rating[j]`
* `rating[i] > rating[j]`

记录坐标`i`中大于自己和小于自己元素的个数.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numTeams(int[] rating) {
        int n = rating.length, res = 0;
        int[] asc = new int[n], desc = new int[n];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (rating[i] > rating[j]) {
                    res += asc[j];
                    ++asc[i];
                } else if (rating[i] != rating[j]) {
                    res += desc[j];
                    ++desc[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
