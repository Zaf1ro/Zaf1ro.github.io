## 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
### 1. Description
You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [$startDay_i$, $endDay_i$]`. Every event `i` starts at `$startDay_i$` and ends at `$endDay_i$`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `$startTime_i \leq d \leq endTime_i$`. You can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

Example:
```
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
```

### 2. Solution
使用一个变量表示天数, 将当天开始的会议加入Priority Queue, 每次只参加一个会议, 并剔除来不及参加的会议.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (a,b)->a[0]-b[0]);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int n = events.length, i = 0, day = 1, res = 0;
        while (i < n || !pq.isEmpty()) {
            while (i < n && day == events[i][0]) pq.offer(events[i++][1]);
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() < day) pq.poll();
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                res++;
                pq.poll();
            }
            day++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
