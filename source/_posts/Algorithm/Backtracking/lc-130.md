## 130 Surrounded Regions
### 1. Description
Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
Example:
```
Input: board = 
[["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","O","O","X"],
 ["X","X","O","X"],
 ["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: 
[["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","O","X","X"]]
```

### 2. Solution
先将外围的X改为P, 再将剩余的O改为X, 最后将P改回O:
```java
class Solution {
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || i == m-1 || j == 0 || j == n-1) dfs(board, i, j, m, n);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') continue;
                if (board[i][j] == 'P') board[i][j] = 'O';
                else board[i][j] = 'X';
            }
        }
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] != 'O') return;
        board[i][j] = 'P';
        dfs(board, i+1, j, m, n);
        dfs(board, i-1, j, m, n);
        dfs(board, i, j+1, m, n);
        dfs(board, i, j-1, m, n);
    }
}
```
