## 638 Shopping Offers
### 1. Description
In LeetCode Store, there are `n` items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the `i^{th}` item, and an integer array `needs` where `needs[i]` is the number of pieces of the `$i^{th}$` item you want to buy.

You are also given an array `special` where `special[i]` is of size `n + 1` where `special[i][j]` is the number of pieces of the `$j^{th}$` item in the `$i^{th}$` offer and `special[i][n]` (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the `$i^{th}$` offer.

Example 1:
```
Input: price = [2,5], special = [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], needs = [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are \$2 and \$5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay \$5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay \$10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay \$10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and \$4 for 2A.
```

### 2. Solution
先计算不用折扣的总价格, 再尝试使用折扣, 找到最小总消费.

```java
class Solution {
    private int n = 0;
    private List<Integer> price;
    private List<List<Integer>> special; 
    
    public int shoppingOffers(List<Integer> price, List<List<Integer>> special, List<Integer> needs) {
        this.n = price.size();
        this.price = price;
        this.special = special;
        return backtracking(needs);
    }

    private int backtracking(List<Integer> needs) {
        int spend = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) spend += price.get(i) * needs.get(i);
        for (List<Integer> s: special) {
            boolean flag = true;
            List<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>(needs);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (s.get(i) > needs.get(i)) {
                    flag = false;
                    break;
                }
                arr.set(i, arr.get(i)-s.get(i));
            }
            if (flag) spend = Math.min(spend, s.get(n)+backtracking(arr));
        }
        return spend;
    } 
}
```
