## 1066. Campus Bikes II
### 1 Description
On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are `n` workers and `m` bikes, with `n <= m`. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

Example:
```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    private int m, n;

    public int assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        m = workers.length;
        n = bikes.length;
        int[][] dist = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dist[i][j] = Math.abs(workers[i][0]-bikes[j][0]) + Math.abs(workers[i][1]-bikes[j][1]);
            }
        }
        return dfs(dist, 0, new int[m][1<<n], 0);
    }

    private int dfs(int[][] dist, int i, int[][] dp, int mask) {
        if (i == m) return 0;
        if (dp[i][mask] > 0) return dp[i][mask];
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (((1 << j) & mask) != 0) continue;
            res = Math.min(res, dist[i][j]+dfs(dist, i+1, dp, mask|(1<<j)));
        }
        dp[i][mask] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
```
