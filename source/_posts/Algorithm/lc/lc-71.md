## 71. Simplify Path
### 1. Description
Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a UNIX-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:
* The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
* Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
* The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
* The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return the simplified **canonical path**.

```text
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

### 2. Solution
思路: UNIX的路径表示有三种情况:
1. ".": current directory
2. "./": current directory
3. "../": one directory up

可使用stack来弹出上级目录
```java
class Solution {
  public String simplifyPath(String path) {
    Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
    String[] arr = path.split("/");
    
    for (String p: arr) {
      if (!stack.isEmpty() && p.equals("..")) /* pop the upper directory */
        stack.pop();
      else if (!p.equals(".") && !p.equals("..") && !p.equals("")) /* push into stack */
        stack.push(p);
    }
    
    String res = "";
    for(String p: stack) res += "/" + p;
    return res.equals("") ? "/" : res;
  }
}
```
