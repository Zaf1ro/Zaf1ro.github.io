## 837. New 21 Game
### 1. Description
Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **"21"**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` or **more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `$10^{-5}$` of the actual answer are considered accepted.

Example:
```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```

### 2. Solution
记录每个点数的概率, 最后计算`[k, n]`之间的概率之和.
```java
class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        double[] dp = new double[n+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j <= i+maxPts && j <= n; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[i] / maxPts;
            }
        }
        double res = 0;
        for (int i = k; i <= n; i++) res += dp[i];
        return res;
    }
}
```

上述代码的复杂度较高, 对于点数`i`, 其概率来自于`[i-maxPts, i-1]`的概率之和. 因此, 如果能记录`[0, i-1]`的概率之和, 则$prob[i] = prob[0,i] - prob[0, i-maxPts-1]$.
```java
class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        double[] dp = new double[n+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        double sum = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += i <= k ? dp[i-1] : 0;
            sum -= i > maxPts ? dp[i-maxPts-1] : 0;
            dp[i] = sum / maxPts;
        }
        for (int i = k; i <= Math.min(k+maxPts-1, n); i++) res += dp[i];
        return res;
    }
}
```
