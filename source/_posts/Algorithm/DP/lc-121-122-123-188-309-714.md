## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
### 1. Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `$i^{th}$` day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

Example:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### 2. Solution
找到数组中的最大值`nums[i]`和最小值`nums[j]`, 且满足`i > j`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max = 0, min = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, prices[i]-min);
            min = Math.min(min, prices[i]); 
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```


## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
### 1. Description
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `$i^{th}$` day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.
Find and return the **maximum** profit you can achieve.

Example:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

### 2. Solution
对于元素`nums[i]`, 分为两种情况:
* `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`: 统计当前差值
* `nums[i] <= nums[i-1]`: 无需任何操作 

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            res += Math.max(prices[i]-prices[i-1], 0);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```


## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
### 1. Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `$i^{th}$` day.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.
**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example:
```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

### 2. Solution
将prices数组分为两个块, 分别为第一次和第二次交易的范围. 找到这两个范围相加最大的profit.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        for (int i = 1, min = prices[0]; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], prices[i]-min);
            min = Math.min(min, prices[i]);
        }
        int res = dp[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2, max = prices[n-1]; i > 0; i--) {
            res = Math.max(res, dp[i-1]+max-prices[i]);
            max = Math.max(max, prices[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
### 1. Description
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `$i^{th}` day, and an integer `k`.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length, res = 0;
        if (n == 0 || k == 0) return 0;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n][k+1][2];
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) dp[0][i][0] = dp[0][i][1] = -10000;
        dp[0][0][0] = 0;
        dp[0][1][1] = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j][0], dp[i-1][j][1]+prices[i]); // sell
                dp[i][j][1] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j][1], dp[i-1][j-1][0]-prices[i]); // buy
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) res = Math.max(res, dp[n-1][i][0]);
        return res;
    }
}
```


## 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
### 1. Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `$i^{th}$` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
* After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

### 2. Solution
卖股票没有任何变化, 区别在于购买股票: 若当前为第`i`天, 则只能从第`i-2`天购买股票.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length, res = 0;
        int[] sell = new int[n], buy = new int[n];
        buy[0] = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1]+prices[i]);
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i-1], (i>1 ? sell[i-2] : 0)-prices[i]);
        }
        return sell[n-1];
    }
}
```


## 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
### 1. Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `$i^{th}$` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Example:
```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

### 2. Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int buy = -prices[0], sell = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            sell = Math.max(sell, prices[i]-fee+buy);
            buy = Math.max(buy, sell-prices[i]);
        }
        return sell;
    }
}
```
